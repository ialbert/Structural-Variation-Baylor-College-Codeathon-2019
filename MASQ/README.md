## Abstract
While metagenomic assembly has significantly improved since the early days of the Human Microbiome Project (HMP), it remains confounded by intragenomic and intergenomic repetitive sequences. Individual reads that span microbial strains (either via long read technology or clever techniques for generating synthetic long reads) to fully resolve variation within a given community. Recent benchmarking studies on error rates in metagenomic assembly range between 1 and 10 major SV error per MB of assembled sequenced. Thus major concern is that detected structural variants could actually result from misassembled data instead of actual strain specific variation. This goal of this project is to identify errors in metagenomic assembly based on short and long read mapping, in the hope of eliminating some of the uncertainty and error in metagenomic studies. Examples of errors we are MASQing are: inversions, chimeras (translocation), indels (<50bp), replacements (large substitutions). We are creating a containerized quality control pipeline called MASQ.

## Getting Started
MasQ uses Python 3.x.

### Data collection and initial processing
downloaded fastq files, ran fastqc to check the quality of the sequencing reads -> good to go!
used megahit and metaspades to build assemblies from long and short reads

### Assembly
Megahit and metaspades are used for short-read metagenomic assembly in the pipeline. These are used to assemble the short reads into representative contigs for the given metagenomic sample.


### Correction
Correction of the metagenomic assemblies is implemented in the varification workflow. Here a interpreter.py script uses a vcf parser to obtain regions structural variation between the assembly and the short reads. Thereafter these structural variations are "fixed" (or reversed) in the assembly. Lastly, in future editions, the number of mapped reads before and after correction will be compared, which should yield further information on the type and impact of that region of missassembly. 

### Validation
We use Truvari to make calls on vcf obtained from different SV callers.

## Key Results

The MasQ pipeline can smoothly and successfully locate assembly errors. Some examples (visualized with IGV) are shown below:

Inversion:

Deletion:
![Deletion Example](https://github.com/NCBI-Codeathons/MASQ/blob/master/figures/k119_15191_1-1_000_large%20del.png)

The MasQ pipeline detected an insertion (labeled Unk570) in the Zymo long read assembly, which is shown by the section of very low mapped reads in IGV. 
![Unk570](https://github.com/NCBI-Codeathons/MASQ/blob/master/figures/unk570_igv_snapshot.png)

This is an example of an assembly error that MasQ will fix during the correction step. The validation script checks the percentage of mapped reads in the corrected assembly and shows a ______ increase in mapped reads from the original assembly. Thus, MasQ was successful in correcting assembly errors.

Here we can see the corrected assembly mapping of the same locus (previously Unk570) visualized with IGV

## Discussion 
### Future Directions
+ Test by running on simulated data
+ Use a machine learning model such as random forest, SVM, or CNN to classify types of assembly errors
#### Machine Learning Model to Classify Assembly Errors
![Random Forest](https://github.com/NCBI-Codeathons/Meta_QC/blob/master/figures/NCBI_hackathon.jpg)
A random forest classifier could be used to classify the type of each assembly error that is detected by the MASQ pipeline. 
*briefly explain what a random forest is and how it will be used to extract imp features and make predictions*
*can use scikit-learn package for Python*
Other options for classification models are SVM (Support Vector Machine) or CNN (Convolutional Neural Network).
