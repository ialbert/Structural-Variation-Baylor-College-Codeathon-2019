# Clouseau
**A QC suite for large VCF files**

## Workflow

![mid_workflow](./plots/mid_workflow.png)

## Usage
``` 
clouseau.py -derp
```

## Output
The output of Clouseau is are a set of files. One file named “sample.tsv.”
```
CHROM	SV1	SV2	SVn	start	end
ChrN  0 1 1 100
ChrN+1 1  1 1 78  
```

Log file for gaps, named "gaps.tsv."
```
Sample_name	gap_start gap_end
Sample 1 	800	1000
```

## Early Planning

## Proposed implementation plan

The code is separated into two modules: Storage and Processing. This allows for easy swap out of Processing module with low level language for faster processing if needed.
